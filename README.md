# Stable Diffusion üñºÔ∏è‚ú®

**Stable Diffusion** is a state-of-the-art diffusion model implemented from scratch using PyTorch. This project encompasses text-to-image generation, image-to-image transformations, and inpainting, allowing for creative applications in generating and editing images based on various inputs.

## Features üåü

- **Diffusion Model from Scratch**: Full implementation of the diffusion process for generating high-quality images.
- **Text-to-Image Generation**: Generate images from textual descriptions, transforming ideas into visuals.
- **Image-to-Image Transformations**: Modify existing images by applying artistic styles or generating variations.
- **Inpainting**: Fill in missing or corrupted parts of images intelligently.
- **Fine-tuning**: Adapt the model to specific artistic styles or tasks (e.g., photorealism, abstract art).
- **Application Building**: Use the trained model for various image generation and editing applications.

## Project Structure üìÇ

- `model/`: The core diffusion model built in PyTorch.
- `training/`: Scripts for training the model on image datasets.
- `finetuning/`: Scripts to fine-tune the model for specific tasks or styles.
- `applications/`: Sample applications for text-to-image generation, image-to-image transformations, and inpainting.

## Getting Started üõ†Ô∏è

### 1. Clone the Repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stable-diffusion.git
cd stable-diffusion
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
Make sure you have PyTorch and other necessary packages installed:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Pretrain the Model
Start pretraining the diffusion model:
```bash
python training/pretrain.py --config config/pretrain_config.json
```

### 4. Fine-tune the Model
Fine-tune the model for specific styles or tasks:
```bash
python finetuning/finetune.py --model-path path_to_pretrained_model
```

### 5. Run Applications
Explore the `applications/` folder to generate images from text prompts, modify existing images, or experiment with inpainting tools.

## Roadmap üõ£Ô∏è

- [ ] Complete diffusion model implementation.
- [ ] Add large-scale pretraining examples.
- [ ] Expand fine-tuning for various artistic styles.
- [ ] Create an interactive UI for text-to-image generation, image-to-image transformations, and inpainting.
